# Third-party notices

## Sparkle update framework

The macOS application embeds [Sparkle 2.9.6](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle)
under its MIT license. The complete Sparkle license and notices for its bundled
components are distributed with the application in
[`SPARKLE_LICENSE.txt`](SimuBoardMac/SimuBoardMac/Resources/SPARKLE_LICENSE.txt).

## Audio used with permission

**BCP (Suit80)** uses 28 derived press/release samples from the recording
`【打字声音】Suit80｜BCP轴｜GMK Ursa 大熊 - Original.mp4`, whose visible uploader
is **J_Eason001**. Redistribution of these derived assets in Battuta's public
application bundle, DMG, source repository, appcast release set, and GitHub
releases is authorized. The permission record is retained privately by the
Battuta maintainer. Battuta downmixed and denoised the recording, then produced
audited 48 kHz mono PCM cuts for keyboard rows, alternate small keys, Shift,
Backspace, Enter, and Space. No endorsement is implied.

## Windows application dependencies

The Windows application uses the following MIT-licensed NuGet packages. Exact
versions are pinned in `BattutaWindows/Directory.Packages.props`.

- [CommunityToolkit.Mvvm](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet)
- [H.NotifyIcon.Wpf](https://github.com/HavenDV/H.NotifyIcon)
- [Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore), including its
  SQLitePCLRaw native SQLite dependencies
- [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)

Their copyright and permission notices are included in the corresponding NuGet
packages. Battuta redistributes these libraries under their MIT terms and does
not remove their notices.

Battuta resampled the G915 recordings to 48 kHz mono PCM, trimmed leading
room tone while retaining a short pre-roll, applied profile gain compensation
(with extra gain for the quieter alternate large-key release), and added a 4 ms
tail fade.

## CC0 1.0 recordings

These recordings were released under the
[CC0 1.0 Universal dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
Attribution is not required by CC0, but the sources and modifications are
recorded here for provenance.

- **Studio Tactile / Studio Clicky** — Ten single-key recordings by StavSounds,
  Freesound pack [Mechanical Keyboards](https://freesound.org/people/StavSounds/packs/42151/),
  sound IDs 766625, 766632–766635, 766605–766606, and 766622–766624.
  Battuta uses the public HQ preview renditions, trims leading room tone while
  retaining a short pre-roll, downmixes to mono, resamples to 48 kHz PCM, and
  separates each complete keystroke into press and release at an audited energy
  valley, with short boundary fades.
- **Kailh Low-profile Blue** — “Fast Typing on Mechanical Keyboard” by
  [HeinzBBQ](https://freesound.org/people/HeinzBBQ/sounds/502653/), Freesound
  sound 502653. Battuta selects five excerpts from the public HQ preview,
  downmixes them to mono, resamples them to 48 kHz PCM, separates the press and
  release events, and excludes neighboring keystrokes from the release samples.
- **Cherry MX Clear** — “Mechanical keyboard clicking. Different keys (4)” by
  [humi74](https://freesound.org/people/humi74/sounds/412926/), Freesound sound
  412926. Battuta selects five excerpts from the public HQ preview, downmixes
  them to mono, resamples them to 48 kHz PCM, and separates the press and
  release events. One excerpt without a usable release reuses the closest clean
  release variation from the same source recording.
- **Pointer Classic, Silent, Crisp, Heavy, and Glass** —
  [Kenney UI Audio](https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-audio) by Kenney Vleugels. The
  source archive was downloaded on 2026-08-22. Battuta derives all five
  generic simulated styles from the matched `mouseclick1.ogg` press recording
  and `mouserelease1.ogg` release recording. Each phase is pitch-lowered with
  compensation for the associated tempo change, then receives profile-specific
  low-pass filtering, restrained midrange EQ and level adjustment; Crisp and
  Glass retain a gentle
  low cut for definition. The process removes leading signal below −45 dBFS
  while retaining up to 2 ms of pre-roll, then adds a 4 ms tail fade and
  renders as 48 kHz mono 16-bit PCM WAV. These style names do not identify or
  claim to reproduce a particular mouse brand or switch. Attribution is not
  required by CC0; it is provided for provenance.
